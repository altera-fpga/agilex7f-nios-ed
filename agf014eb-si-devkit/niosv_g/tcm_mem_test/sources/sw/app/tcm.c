 * TCM (Tightly Coupled Memories) example. 
 *
 * This example requires a performance_counter, as found in full_featured 
 * hardware designs. Also, the system clock timer must be set to sys_clk_timer.
 * 
 * This program is an example which demonstrates measurement of interrupt 
 * latency and memory access speed in a Nios V system.  Tightly Coupled
 * Memories in particular are highlighted as the fastest accessible memory in
 * a Nios V system, perfect for storing things such as exception handlers and 
 * the exception stack.
 * See the Hello Freestanding software example and 
 * associated readme.txt for additional details on alt_main() and low-level
 * system initialization step descriptions.
 *
 * Please refer to this TCM software example's file readme.txt for notes on 
 * this software example, including notes on system library settings for 
 * locating the exception stack separately from other program data, the
 * fastest location is the tightly coupled data memory, configured as a 
 * dual-port, Avalon channel, onchip memory in the full-featured Nios V hardware
 * design.
