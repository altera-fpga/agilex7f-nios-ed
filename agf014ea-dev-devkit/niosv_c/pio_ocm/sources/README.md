### 1. Directory Structure:

The directory structure of this top-level project folder is explained below:

- hw - necessary hardware files (.qpf, .qsf, .sv, .v, .ip) of the design

- sw - This folder contains software application files

- scripts - This folder consists of scripts to build the design

### 2. Using existing files to run the design on hardware

- The sof and elf files required to run the design can be found in "ready_to_test" folder 

- Refer the Hardware validation section (3.d) for the steps  

### 3. Building the design from scratch

The steps to build the project from scratch are mentioned below:

a. Required directory structure
- The top-level project folder should have directory structure as mentioned in Section 1 (Directory Structure).

b. Using build_sof.py to compile the design
- Invoke the quartus_py shell in the terminal

- Run the following command in the terminal from top level project directory:
```
quartus_py ./scripts/build_sof.py
```
- The quartus tool will compile the design and generate the output files

c. Creating the bsp, build software sources and download elf
- To create software app, run the following commands in the terminal

- Clean the app build project before regenerating elf
```
niosv-bsp -c --quartus-project=hw/top.qpf --qsys=hw/qsys_top.qsys --type=hal sw/bsp/settings.bsp
niosv-app --bsp-dir=sw/bsp --app-dir=sw/app --srcs=sw/app/main.c
niosv-shell
cmake -S ./sw/app -B sw/app/build -G "Unix Makefiles"
make -C sw/app/build
elf2hex sw/app/build/app.elf -b 0x0 -w 32 -e 0x9ffff sw/app/build/onchip_mem.hex -r4
```

d. Hardware Validation
- Program the generated sof and then download the elf file on the board
```
quartus_pgm --cable=1 -m jtag -o 'p;ready_to_test/top.sof'  
```
- Reduce the JTAG clock frequency to 6MHz before programming the application .elf file on the board.
```
jtagconfig --setparam 1 JtagClock 6M
```
- Verify the output on the terminal by using the following command in the terminal:
```
juart-terminal -d 1 -c 1 -i 0
```

### 4. Running simulation

Simulation is enabled for this design where the memory is initialized with the application hex. Use the following commands to run the simulation:

- Generate Testbench from Platform Designer. Generate -> Generate Testbench System

```    
cp ./sw/app/build/onchip_mem.hex ./qsys_top_tb/qsys_top_tb/sim/mentor
cd hw/qsys_top_tb/qsys_top_tb/sim/mentor/
vsim &
source msim_setup.tcl
ld_debug
run -all
```
