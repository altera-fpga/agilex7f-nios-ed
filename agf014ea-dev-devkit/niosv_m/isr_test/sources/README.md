# Nios® V/m Processor – Timer Interval Interrupt Test

 Nios V/m Processor-based Timer Interrupt design Example on Agilex® 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit P-Tile and E-Tile DK-DEV-AGF014EA

## Description

This example design includes a NIOS V/m embedded processor connected to the Interval Timer IP to issue alarm-based interrupt to the NIOSV/m core. 
The objective of the design is to demonstrate the interrupt behavior and handling by the Nios V embedded processor. Once the interrupt is issued; the Nios V prints the system ID of the SYS ID peripheral core.

### Prerequisites

 - Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (P-Tile and E-Tile), ordering code DK-DEV-AGF014EA. Refer to the board documentation for more information about the development kit.
 - Mini and Micro USB Cable. Included with the development kit.
 - Host PC with 64 GB of RAM. Less will be fine for only exercising the binaries, and not rebuilding the GHRD.

### Release Contents  

#### Binaries
 - Prebuilt binaries are located [here](https://github.com/altera-fpga/agilex7f-nios-ed/blob/rel/25.1.1/agf014ea-dev-devkit/niosv_m/pio_test/ready_to_test).
 - The sof and elf files required to simulate the design can be found in "ready_to_test" folder 

#### Nios® V/m Processor
- Microcontroller- Balanced (For interrupt driven baremetal and RTOS code)
- Nios® V/m processor is highly customizable and can be tailored to meet specific application requirements, providing flexibility and scalability in embedded system designs.
 
#### IP Cores
 The following IPs are used in this Platform Designer component of the design:
- Nios® V/m soft processor core

- On Chip RAM-II

- JTAG UART

- Timer

- System ID

- Clock Bridge, Reset Controller


### Hardware Setup

  Refer to [Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (P-Tile and E-Tile) Development Kit User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683024.html) to setup the hardware connection.

### Environment Setup

#### Tools Download and Installation
1. Quartus Prime Pro

 - Download the Quartus® Prime Pro Edition software version 25.1 from the FPGA Software Download Center webpage of the Intel website. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. Choose an installation directory that is relative to the Quartus® Prime Pro Edition software installation directory.
 - Set up the Quartus tools in the PATH, so they are accessible without full path.
```console
	export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR=~/intelFPGA_pro/25.1.1/quartus/
	export PATH=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin:$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/linux64:$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../qsys/bin:$PATH
```

# Getting Started

Vendor: Altera

1. Directory structure
2. Using existing files (sof and elf) to run on hardware
3. Building the design from scratch

    a.	Required directory structure

    b.	Use of build_sof.py to compile the design

    c.	Steps to create the bsp and build software sources

    d.  Hardware Validation 

### 1. Directory Structure:

The directory structure is explained below:

- hw- necessary hardware files (.qpf, .qsf, .sv, .v, .ip) of the design

- sw- This folder contains software application files

- scripts- This folder consists of scripts to build the design


### 2. Using existing files to run the design on hardware

- The sof and elf files required to run the design can be found in "ready_to_test" folder 

- Refer the Hardware validation section (3.d) for the steps  


### 3. Building the design from scratch

The steps to build the project from scratch are mentioned below:

a. Required directory structure
- The top-level project folder should have directory structure as mentioned in Section 1 (Directory Structure).

b. Using build_sof.py to compile the design
- Invoke the quartus_py shell in the terminal

- Run the following command in the terminal from top level project directory:
```
quartus_py ./scripts/build_sof.py
```
- The quartus tool will compile the design and generate the output files

c. Creating the bsp, build software sources and download elf
- To create software app, run the following commands in the terminal:

- Clean the app build project before regenerating elf

```  
niosv-bsp -c --quartus-project=hw/top.qpf --qsys=hw/qsys_top.qsys --type=hal sw/bsp/settings.bsp
niosv-app --bsp-dir=sw/niosv_bsp --app-dir=sw/niosv_app --srcs=sw/niosv_app/main.c
niosv-shell
cmake -S ./sw/app -B sw/app/build
make -C sw/app/build
elf2hex sw/app/build/app.elf -b 0x0 -w 32 -e 0x9ffff hw/onchip_mem.hex
```

d. Hardware Validation
- Program the generated sof and then download the elf file on the board
```        
quartus_pgm --cable=1 -m jtag -o 'p;ready_to_test/top.sof'
``` 
- Reduce the JTAG clock frequency to 6MHz before programming the application .elf file on the board.
```
jtagconfig --setparam 1 JtagClock 6M
```
- Download the elf file on the board 
```    
niosv-download -g ready_to_test/app.elf -c 1
``` 
- Verify the output on the terminal by using the following command in the terminal:
``` 
juart-terminal -d 1 -c 1 -i 0 
```
