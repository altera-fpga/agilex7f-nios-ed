# Nios® V/m Processor – OCM to OCM Memory Test example Design

 Nios V/m Processor-based On-Chip Memory (OCM) Test design Example on Agilex® 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit P-Tile and E-Tile DK-DEV-AGF014EA

## Description

This example design includes a NIOS V/m embedded processor connected to the OCM and JTAG UART IP. 
The objective of the design is to write and read into specific locations of On Chip RAM. This implementation of On Chip RAM uses the Avalon interface.

### Prerequisites

 - Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (P-Tile and E-Tile), ordering code DK-DEV-AGF014EA. Refer to the board documentation for more information about the development kit.
 - Mini and Micro USB Cable. Included with the development kit.
 - Host PC with 64 GB of RAM. Less will be fine for only exercising the binaries, and not rebuilding the GHRD.

### Release Contents  

#### Binaries
 - Prebuilt binaries are located [here](https://github.com/altera-fpga/agilex7f-nios-ed/blob/rel/25.1.1/agf014ea-dev-devkit/niosv_m/ocm_mem_test/ready_to_test).
 - The sof and elf files required to simulate the design can be found in "ready_to_test" folder 

#### Nios® V/m Processor
- Microcontroller- Balanced (For interrupt driven baremetal and RTOS code)
- Nios® V/m processor is highly customizable and can be tailored to meet specific application requirements, providing flexibility and scalability in embedded system designs.
 
#### IP Cores
 The following IPs are used in this Platform Designer component of the design:
- Nios® V/m soft processor core

- On Chip RAM-II

- JTAG UART

- System ID

- Clock Bridge, Reset Controller


### Hardware Setup

  Refer to [Agilex™ 7 FPGA F-Series Development Kit (P-Tile and E-Tile) Development Kit User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683024.html) to setup the hardware connection.

### Environment Setup

#### Tools Download and Installation
1. Quartus Prime Pro

 - Download the Quartus® Prime Pro Edition software version 25.1 from the FPGA Software Download Center webpage of the Intel website. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. Choose an installation directory that is relative to the Quartus® Prime Pro Edition software installation directory.
 - Set up the Quartus tools in the PATH, so they are accessible without full path.
```console
	export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR=~/intelFPGA_pro/25.1.1/quartus/
	export PATH=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin:$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/linux64:$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../qsys/bin:$PATH
```

# Getting Started

Vendor: Altera

1. Directory structure
2. Using existing files (sof and elf) to run on hardware
3. Building the design from scratch

    a.	Required directory structure

    b.	Use of build_sof.py to compile the design

    c.	Steps to create the bsp and build software sources

    d.  Hardware Validation

4. Running simulation	

### 1. Directory Structure:

The directory structure is explained below:

- hw- necessary hardware files (.qpf, .qsf, .sv, .v, .ip) of the design

- sw- This folder contains software application files

- scripts- This folder consists of scripts to build the design


### 2. Using existing files to run the design on hardware

- The sof and elf files required to run the design can be found in "ready_to_test" folder 

- Refer the Hardware validation section (3.d) for the steps  


### 3. Building the design from scratch

The steps to build the project from scratch are mentioned below:

a. Required directory structure
- The top-level project folder should have directory structure as mentioned in Section 1 (Directory Structure).

b. Using build_sof.py to compile the design
- Invoke the quartus_py shell in the terminal

- Run the following command in the terminal from top level project directory:
```
quartus_py ./scripts/build_sof.py
```
- The quartus tool will compile the design and generate the output files

c. Creating the bsp, build software sources and download elf
- To create software app, run the following commands in the terminal:

- Clean the app build project before regenerating elf

```  
niosv-bsp -c --quartus-project=hw/top.qpf --qsys=hw/qsys_top.qsys --type=hal sw/bsp/settings.bsp
niosv-app --bsp-dir=sw/niosv_bsp --app-dir=sw/niosv_app --srcs=sw/niosv_app/main.c
niosv-shell
cmake -S ./sw/app -B sw/app/build
make -C sw/app/build
elf2hex sw/app/build/app.elf -b 0x0 -w 32 -e 0xfffff hw/onchip_mem.hex
```

d. Hardware Validation
- Program the generated sof and then download the elf file on the board
```        
quartus_pgm --cable=1 -m jtag -o 'p;ready_to_test/top.sof'
``` 
- Reduce the JTAG clock frequency to 6MHz before programming the application .elf file on the board.
```
jtagconfig --setparam 1 JtagClock 6M
```
- Download the elf file on the board 
```    
niosv-download -g ready_to_test/app.elf -c 1
``` 
- Verify the output on the terminal by using the following command in the terminal:
``` 
juart-terminal -d 1 -c 1 -i 0 
```

#### 4. Running simulation

Simulation is enabled for this design where the memory is initialized with the application hex. Use the following commands to run the simulation:

- Generate Testbench from Platform Designer. Generate -> Generate Testbench System 
```	
cp ./sw/app/build/onchip_mem.hex ./qsys_top_tb/qsys_top_tb/sim/mentor 
cd hw/qsys_top_tb/qsys_top_tb/sim/mentor/
vsim &
source msim_setup.tcl
ld_debug
run -all
```
