### Environment Setup

#### Tools Download and Installation
1. Quartus Prime Pro

 - Download the Quartus® Prime Pro Edition software version 25.1.1 from the FPGA Software Download Center webpage of the Intel website. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. Choose an installation directory that is relative to the Quartus® Prime Pro Edition software installation directory.
 - Set up the Quartus tools in the PATH, so they are accessible without full path.
```console
export QUARTUS_ROOTDIR=~/intelFPGA_pro/25.1.1/quartus/
export PATH=$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/bin:$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/linux64:$QUARTUS_ROOTDIR/../qsys/bin:$PATH
```
# Getting Started

Vendor: Altera

1. Directory structure
2. Using existing files (sof and elf) to run on hardware
3. Building the design from scratch
    
    a. Required directory structure

    b. Use of build_sof.py to compile the design
    
    c. Steps to create the bsp and build software sources

    d.  Hardware Validation 
 
### 1. Directory Structure:
 
The directory structure of this top-level project folder is explained below:

- hw - necessary hardware files (.qpf, .qsf, .sv, .v, .ip) of the design

- sw - This folder contains software application files

- scripts - This folder consists of scripts to build the design

### 2. Using existing files to run the design on hardware
 
- The sof and elf files required to run the design can be found in "ready_to_test" folder 

- Refer the Hardware validation section (3.d) for the steps
 
### 3. Building the design from scratch
 
The steps to build the project from scratch are mentioned below:
 
a. Required directory structure
- The top-level project folder should have directory structure as mentioned in Section 1 (Directory Structure).
 
b. Using build_sof.py to compile the design
- Invoke the quartus_py shell in the terminal

- Run the following command in the terminal from top level project directory:
 ```
 quartus_py ./scripts/build_sof.py
```
- The quartus tool will compile the design and generate the output files
 
c. Creating the bsp, build software sources and download elf
- To create software app, run the following commands in the terminal
- Clean the app build project before regenerating elf
- Niosv/m application
```console
niosv-bsp -c --quartus-project=hw/top.qpf --qsys=hw/qsys_top.qsys --type=hal sw/bsp_lockstep/settings.bsp -i=intel_niosv_m_0
niosv-app --bsp-dir=sw/bsp_lockstep --app-dir=sw/app_lockstep --srcs=sw/app_lockstep/lockstep.c
cmake -S ./sw/app_lockstep -B sw/app_lockstep/build
make -C sw/app_lockstep/build
```

- Niosv/g application
```console
niosv-bsp -c --quartus-project=hw/top.qpf --qsys=hw/qsys_top.qsys --type=hal sw/bsp_lockstep_hello/settings.bsp -i=intel_niosv_g_0
niosv-app --bsp-dir=sw/bsp_lockstep_hello --app-dir=sw/app_lockstep_hello --srcs=sw/app_lockstep_hello/hello.c
cmake -S ./sw/app_lockstep_hello -B sw/app_lockstep_hello/build
make -C sw/app_lockstep_hello/build
```

d. Hardware Validation
- Program the generated sof and then download the elf file on the board
```  
quartus_pgm --cable=1 -m jtag -o 'p;ready_to_test/top.sof'
```
- Reduce the JTAG clock frequency to 6MHz before programming the application .elf file on the board.
``` 
jtagconfig --setparam 1 JtagClock 6M
```
- Download the elf file on the board (First download the Niosv/m app and then the Niosv/g app)
```
niosv-download -g sw/app_lockstep/build/app_lockstep.elf -c 1 -i 1
```
```
niosv-download -g sw/app_lockstep_hello/build/app_lockstep_hello.elf -c 1 -i 0
```
- Verify the output on the terminal by using the following command in the terminal:
``` 
juart-terminal -d 1 -c 1 -i 1
```
``` 
juart-terminal -d 1 -c 1 -i 0
```
